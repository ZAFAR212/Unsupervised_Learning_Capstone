Unsupervised_Learning_Capstone
This project aims to perform unsupervised parametric and non parametric ML such principal component analysis, k-means & Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering on the US Arrest dataset

Description of the project:
 - This capstone project applies principal component analysis, k-means and hierarchical clustering to a real world dataset in python. 
 - I have used the sklearn library to complete this project. These techniques can be useful for exploratory data analysis and for segmentation of groups within your data.
 - Understanding linear algebra, contrained maximisation / lagrange multipliers and some statistics can really help with the interpretation of the pca's output. 
 - You may also use the biplot to understand better how individual features play a role in generating the principal components themselves. 
 - We run some evaluation measures such as cumulative sum of explained variance and Silhuoette score to identify the optimal number of clusters. 
 - We also provide a state and region breakdown of the different crimes and perform some exploratory analysis to understand the relationship between variables which is confirmed by the PCA.
